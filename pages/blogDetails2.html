          <p class="card-text">As we age, the discs in our spine can degenerate, causing chronic pain and discomfort in the back and neck that can significantly impact daily life. Understanding what degenerative disc disease (DDD) is, its symptoms, causes, and the available treatment options can help you manage this common condition and improve your quality of life.Degenerative disc disease is a condition that affects the discs between the vertebrae in your spine. Each disc has a gelatinous center and a tougher outer covering. These discs act like cushions, absorbing shock and allowing flexibility and movement in your back. Over time, the discs can degenerate. This can lead to pain and discomfort in your back and neck from the loss of protective cushioning.
            DDD is a natural part of aging. It is not actually a "disease," but rather a condition that can cause symptoms if the discs deteriorate significantly. When discs are damaged, the inner part can push out and press on the spinal cord or nerve. This is known as a herniated or "slipped" disc, and it may cause weakness. The disc can also become so worn out that the vertebrae start to rub together.
